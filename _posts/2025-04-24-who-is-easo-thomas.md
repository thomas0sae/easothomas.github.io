title: Who is Easo Thomas?
---
Easo Thomas is another Software Engineer turned Architect turned Engineering Manager, who is trying his best to keep up with the fast paced Technology landscape. Easo Thomas has worked with over 35 different technologies in his 20 year old career, but most of it are either obsolete or never gets asked in the interviews, or don't help him to the next best opportunity. So he is still trying his best to solve at least 100 Hard Leetcode problems before the end of 2025, to increase his chance of getting hired or stay at the current level.

Easo Thomas wants to be the best communicator in the world. He thinks people have lost the art of communication by sitting in front of the computers which never communicates back to them or talk back to humans. But they only give notifications. Easo Thomas is ecstatic that AI might solve this problem by introducing smart AI agents which can talk to you and communicate with you verbally.

Easo Thomas has attempted to drink his share of startup poison in the past. He has worked with his friends on many a startup, attempting himself to create a dating app for Indians, a neighborhood app for Indians, and also he attempted creating a Resume ATS service in 2018.

Every word in this post was handwritten by Easo Thomas himself, and not by an LLM. If there are mistakes or missing punctuation, thats your proof that it was written by poor him! Easo Thomas does make mistakes, but quickly learns from it, and try my best to not repeat it ever. I also make sure I share the learnings with others. The last mistake he did was when writing this post, and he  took 4 commits to make it right!
